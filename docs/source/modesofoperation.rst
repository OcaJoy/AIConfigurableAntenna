Modes of Operation
==================
- **Mode 1: Home Antennas**
  
  | All antennas are moved back to their retracted end position

- **Mode 2: Move Antennas based on inputted frequency**
  
  | The Main Antennas extend or retract to the desired calculated length based on the inputted frequency. Then, the Reflector Antennas are moved to have their distance match the length of the Main Antennas.
  | The user is required to input a frequency within 326 MHz - 1.314 GHz.

- **Mode 3: Move Antennas to the desired length in centimeters**  

  | The Main Antennas extend or retract to the desired length inputted. Then, the Reflector Antennas are moved to have their distance match the length of the Main Antennas. 
  | The user is required to input the length of a single main antenna between 5.7 - 23 cm.

- **Mode 4: Move only the Main Antennas to the desired length in centimeters** 
 
  | The Main Antennas extend or retract to the desired length inputted. The distance of the Reflector Antennas remains unchanged.
  | The user is required to input the length of a single main antenna between 5.7 - 23 cm.

- **Mode 5: Move only the Main Antenna Holder to the desired distance in centimeters**  

  | The Main Antennas Holders extend or retract to the desired distance from the center inputted. The distance of the Reflector Antennas remains unchanged.
  | The user is required to input the distance of a single main antenna holder from the center between 6.7 - 23 cm

- **Mode 6: Move only the Reflector Antennas to the desired distance in centimeters**

  | The Reflector Antennas extend or retract to the desired distance from the main antennas. The length of the Main Antennas remains unchanged.
  | The user is required to input the distance of the reflector antennas from the main antennas between 6.6 - 18.7 cm.
